# AllergyTracker - Full Stack Application

## Overview

AllergyTracker is a modern web application designed to help users manage and track food allergies and dietary schedules. The application features a calendar-based interface for scheduling and tracking food consumption with customizable frequencies and visual indicators.

## System Architecture

### Full Stack Structure
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management

### Directory Structure
```
├── client/          # React frontend application
├── server/          # Express.js backend API
├── shared/          # Shared TypeScript schemas and types
├── components.json  # shadcn/ui configuration
└── migrations/      # Database migration files
```

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **shadcn/ui** component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with Apple-inspired design system
- **TanStack Query** for API state management and caching
- **React Hook Form** with Zod validation for form handling
- **Wouter** for lightweight client-side routing

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js** server with TypeScript
- **RESTful API** design pattern
- **Drizzle ORM** for database operations
- **Zod** for runtime type validation
- **In-memory storage** with interface for easy database migration

### Data Storage
- **PostgreSQL** database (configured via Drizzle)
- **Neon Database** serverless PostgreSQL provider
- **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe database operations
- **Database migrations** managed through Drizzle Kit

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: React components make API calls using TanStack Query
2. **API Layer**: Express.js routes handle HTTP requests with validation
3. **Business Logic**: Server-side logic processes requests and manages data
4. **Data Persistence**: Drizzle ORM interacts with PostgreSQL database
5. **Response**: JSON responses sent back to client with proper error handling

### Database Schema
- **Foods Table**: Stores food items with name, instructions, color, frequency, and status
- **Schedule Entries Table**: Tracks daily food scheduling with completion status
- **Foreign Key Relationships**: Schedule entries reference foods table

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: PostgreSQL connection for serverless environments
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe ORM for database operations
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible UI primitives
- **react-hook-form**: Form state management
- **zod**: Runtime type validation

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript**: Static type checking
- **Vite**: Build tool and development server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **ESBuild**: Fast JavaScript bundler for production

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Frontend Build**: Vite compiles React app to static assets
2. **Backend Build**: ESBuild bundles Express server for Node.js
3. **Database Setup**: Drizzle migrations ensure schema consistency

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Local development with hot reload
- **Production**: Optimized builds with environment-specific configurations
- **Database**: Environment-specific DATABASE_URL configuration

### Deployment Architecture
- **Static Assets**: Frontend served from `dist/public`
- **API Server**: Express.js backend serves API routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL hosted on Neon (serverless)
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration for database connections
